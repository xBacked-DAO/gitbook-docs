# Glossary

**Minting:** the process of putting new xUSD tokens into circulation

**Collateral:** token types allowed to be deposited when opening a vault. To begin with, xBacked will only support ALGO.

**System Debt:** the total supply of xUSD in the system

**Vault:** owned by a user, and it is the primary mechanism for a user to mint xUSD

**Vault Debt:** the amount of xUSD a vault minted.

**Liquidation:** performed by the xBacked protocol using xUSD staked in the liquidation pool. Will liquidate vaults with an unhealthy collateral ratio.

**Redemption:** allows users to redeem 1 xUSD for $1 of system collateral. This is done by selecting the riskiest vault in the system.

**Withdrawing:** the process of removing collateral in a vault, back into your wallet.

**Staking:** the process of locking tokens in a contract.

**Collateral Ratio:** the ratio of collateral to debt. The system, and vaults within the system, must always have more collateral than debt to maintain the peg.&#x20;
