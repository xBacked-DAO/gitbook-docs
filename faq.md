# FAQ

## What is the interest rate?

0% interest on minted debt, instead a fee is charged.

## What collateral can I use?

Currently, only ALGO. In the near future, goBTC & goETH have strong liquidity. In the further future the team and community will assess other options.

## Will I still receive ALGO Rewards?

No, you will not receive Algo rewards. These will accrue in the vault, and when the vault eventually closes the DAO will receive any accrued rewards. In this event, the DAO will create a community proposal for how the funds should be used.

## Can I participate in Algorand Governance via xBacked?

Currently, this is not possible to do in a decentralized way. We look forward collaborating with Algorand on future iterations of Governance so that DeFi protocols can ensure users can participate in governance, in a decentralized & permisionless way while still using the protocol.

Alternatively, perhaps there will be a "liquid staking" product for Algorand, and that can be a collateral type on xBacked.

## What are the fees for xBacked?

[Documentation on our fee structure is here.](product/fees.md)

| Action       | Fee  |
| ------------ | ---- |
| Minting xUSD | 0.5% |
| Liquidations | 1%   |
| Redemptions  | 2%   |

## What is the minimum collateral ratio?

Vaults below 110% can be liquidated, and the protocol prevents users putting their vault close to this level, creating a strong incentive to be at least 120%. [Read more about vaults here.](product/vaults.md)

## What is the minimum amount of collateral required to open a vault?

$100 USD.

## Is xBacked a DAO?

Yes, we are working towards a fully decentralized governance model.
